GME1011 - Assignment 2

For this assignment, I had to use AI in two parts of my code. 

1. I tried everything to make my buttons (textures) work, but when I tried to draw them, it says that the attribute was null. After hours
trying to understand what was the problem, I gave up and asked for help to AI.

The solution was to load the content twice, in Game1, and in my object Class. Even though that I asked why I had to do that, I do not
understand the answer that it gave me. Which is why I added comments to try to ask in a future oop class.

2. Making the Update work in seconds. Even that I received an email explaining this to me, and watching the recordings of the entire
semester, every time that I tried to write that line resulted in a syntax error.

The AI recommended me to use TimeSpan, and finally I was able to make it work.

Besides that, everything was taken from examples in class, recordings from the classes, and the information available in Moodle.

In my experience, it was helpful using it because as a student you can make a mistake - even though that you are following every step. In this cases, the AI is helpful to explain the issue, the solution, and to let you keep moving forward in your assignment.
